# Image Processing Visualizer

Visualization for image processing algorithms.

## Introduction

In image processing, a kernel, convolution matrix, or mask is a small matrix. It is used for blurring, sharpening, embossing, edge detection, and more. This is accomplished by doing a convolution between a kernel and an image. See the algorithms in action on <a href="https://ziyi-zhu.github.io/image-processing-visualizer/">Image Processing Visuailizer</a>.

## Dependencies

Install Express in the `root` directory and save it in the dependencies list. For example:

```sh
npm install express --save
```

To install Express temporarily and not add it to the dependencies list:

```sh
npm install express --no-save
```
